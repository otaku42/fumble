# fumble

... is my (opinionated) take on coming up with a more pythonic interface to a
CLI / command parser based on regular expressions.

It was written mainly for one of my other projects, which is basically a
mumble bot. I'm not sure if it could be of use for others, especially given
the current lack of documentation.

## Why *fumble*?

The initial name of that library was *clippy* - which would have been for
something like ***CLI*** ***p****arser for* ***py****thon*. However, looking
at PyPI I found that there were a fair amount of other packages that use a
similar or the same name. One of them is
[Clippy](https://pypi.org/project/Clippy/), which is described with "... 
generates command-line interfaces for Python". Guess what the name stands
for? Command Line Interface Parser for Python - doh!

That demanded for a new name. But whatever idea I came up with, it was a
similar situation. "What the fu...mble?!" Ha, there it was... according to the
dictionary "to fumble for words" means something along the lines of "to look
for words". Fair enough. So, *fumble* it is.
